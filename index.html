<p>While mainly white-populated Harris hosts the highest average rate of opioid related overdoses in New York, it does not have substance use treatment centers. A Harlem zip code—where the average overdose rate is lower than Harris’s— houses 10 treatment centers.</p>

<p>“People need to be treated where they live,”  lifelong Harlem resident Maria Granville, 67, said.</p>

<p>The reason rural Harris does not house a treatment center despite their alarming need is due to residents being against it, Granville said.</p>

<p>Harlem once needed drug treatment during the late 1960s, she said. When they no longer needed treatment centers, the community advocated to move centers from the neighborhood. Instead, companies built more treatment centers in the community within the borders of the redline map of Harlem. </p>

<p>“This just needs to be spread out all over the city,” Granville added. “Why are 6,000 people coming to Harlem?”</p>
